# Blackjack

Single page Blackjack game written in Angular.

### Introduction

Built using Angular.js to expand my knowledge on the framework. I kick started
the project using a generator from Yeoman, the generator I used was called
[angular-fullstack].

### Getting started

Run the following commands:

- npm install - Install all required node packages
- bower install - Install all required bower packages
- grunt serve - Serve the project locally

Run tests using the following command:

- grunt test - Run all jasmine tests

### TODOs

- Write more unit tests around the ending of the game.
- Remove the hard coded amount of players and make dynamic.
- Use Socket.io to make the truly multiplayer.
